Play Scala Tutorials

In this repo we would set up the development environment with Play and Eclipse which would drive us through rest of the tutorial series. We would be running this repo as a series and we would be looking at various aspects of play with this blog.

###Development Requirements :-

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/install.html) and [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Setup.html)
  * You can also use [Activator](https://www.lightbend.com/community/core-tools/activator-and-sbt#getting-started) (included in this repo), but it adds a lot of bloat. Great for bootstrapping templates, but then just use `sbt`
* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
  * Alternatively, [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
  * The steps [here])https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_For_Development_With_Vagrant#Database_Setup) will show how to setup the DB locally
